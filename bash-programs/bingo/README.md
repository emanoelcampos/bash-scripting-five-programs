# Bingo Number Generator

This is a script that generates random numbers for a Bingo game. It ensures that each generated number is unique, so there are no repetitions during the game.

3. The number will be displayed on the screen and prints it along with the corresponding letter (`B, I, N, G, or O`).
4. The `script` will continue generating numbers until all possible numbers have been generated.
