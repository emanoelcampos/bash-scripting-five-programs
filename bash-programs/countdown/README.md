# Countdown Timer

This is a `script` that provides a *countdown timer* functionality. It allows you to set a specific time and then counts down to zero from that time. It's a handy tool for time management, reminders, or any situation where you need a precise countdown.

## How to use

2. Enter the time for the countdown as an `argument`.

4. When a number other than a *positive integer* is entered, a notification will be displayed.
