# Bash Scripting: Building Five Programs

This repository contains five small `Bash` programs created as part of the [freeCodeCamp's Relational Database Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/). Each program serves a different purpose and demonstrates various `Bash` *scripting techniques*.

## Programs

1. **Questionnaire (`questionnaire.sh`)**: A simple questionnaire `script` that prompts the user with three questions and prints the responses. 


2. **Countdown Timer (`countdown.sh`)**: A countdown timer `script` that takes a positive integer as an argument and counts down to zero, pausing for one second between each number. 


3. **Bingo Number Generator (`bingo.sh`)**: A `script` that generates a random bingo number between 1 and 75 and prints it along with the corresponding letter (`B, I, N, G, or O`). 


4. **Fortune Teller (`fortune.sh`)**: A fortune-telling `script` that prompts the user to ask a yes or no question and provides a random response from a predefined set of answers.


5. **Five Program Runner (`five.sh`)**: A `script` that runs all the other four programs consecutively.

## Usage 

To run any of the programs, simply execute the corresponding .sh file in your terminal. For example: 

```bash
./questionnaire.sh
```

To run all programs consecutively, execute the `five.sh` script:

```bash
./five.sh
```

## Getting Started

These scripts can be used as examples to learn Bash scripting or as standalone tools for various purposes. Feel free to modify and customize them according to your needs.
